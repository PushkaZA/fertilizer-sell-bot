# Fertilizer Sell Bot

I'm not sure if this is undetected by Rust, but it uses some pretty bad mouse movement and keypress methods.

How to Use

  1. Make sure python is install

  2. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

  3. Run main.py

  If it doesn't work, you may have to play around with the RGB values found on line 19.

Don't judge the code. I made it as a POC after seeing someone doing the same thing and getting an inventory of scrap.

Enjoy!
